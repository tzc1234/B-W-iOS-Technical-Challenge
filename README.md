# iOS Technical Test
Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to complete this technical challenge. The project is written in Swift and follows the Clean Architecture pattern. It retrieves a list of products and displays a detailed product screen.

Once completed, please share your code either in github repository, or email the zipped folder to aleksandar@bloomandwild.com

## Tasks

- Crash Fix: We've identified a crash that occurs when tapping on a product cell. Your task is to diagnose and fix this issue.
- SwiftUI Migration: The current product details screen is built using UIKit. We'd like you to migrate it to SwiftUI, maintaining the existing functionality.
- Image Loading Review: Identify any potential issues with the way the project loads images for products. If you find areas for improvement, refactor the code to optimize image loading while adhering to the project's Clean Architecture structure.

## Bonus Points

- Implement unit tests for any code you modify or create.
- Improve code readability by adding clear and concise comments throughout your changes.
- Feel free to suggest any other improvements you see within the project's scope.


## Benefits

By completing these tasks, you'll showcase your skills in:
- Swift development
- Clean Architecture principles
- UIKit and SwiftUI UI development
- Code optimization
- Unit testing

This will help us assess your suitability for the role.

### Additional Notes
Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have during the test.
If successful you will be invited to walk through your solution with a couple of engineers and explain your architecture style and the decisions you have made. Please make sure you have the solution set up and ready to demo.
